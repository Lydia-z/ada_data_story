You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Lydia-z/ada_data_story/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Background

Brexit (a portmanteau of "British exit") was the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU) at 23:00 GMT on 31 January 2020 (00:00 CET). The UK is the first and so far the only member state to have left the EU, after 47 years of having been a part of the union — the EU and its predecessor the European Communities (EC), which included the European Economic Community — since 1 January 1973. Actually, the United Kindom was considering about exiting the EU ever since 2016. After several referendums and negotiations between UK-EU, they finally exit the EU in early January, 2020. And the withdrawl aggrement finally came into force on 31 January 2020. 

In our project, we would like to dive into quotations talking about the Brexit and analyze information behind these quotations to learn about people's attitude through the whole event.
